## webAPI

# Description
WebAPI project. This is supposed to be a multiple choice quiz. I did not get it to a working state in the alloted amount of time. I have the questions formatted as buttons right now in the HTML. I would like to continue to work and develope the quiz using the proper click functions in JS rather than having them listed in the HTML. as well as getting the timer and alert working.
